# AI Agent Memory and Expertise System

This document outlines how AI agents should leverage local-memory for persistent memory, knowledge accumulation, and expertise building across conversations.

## Overview

Local-memory provides AI agents with the ability to:
- Store and retrieve memories across sessions
- Build cumulative knowledge and expertise
- Learn from past interactions and decisions
- Maintain context and continuity
- Develop specialized knowledge domains

## Memory Integration Strategy

### 1. Automatic Memory Storage

**When to Store Memories:**
- Key insights or learnings from user interactions
- Problem-solving patterns and solutions
- Domain-specific knowledge discoveries
- User preferences and context
- Project details and architectural decisions
- Code patterns and best practices
- Error resolutions and debugging strategies

**Memory Categories:**
- `expertise` - Technical knowledge and skills
- `user-context` - User preferences and working patterns
- `project-knowledge` - Project-specific information
- `solutions` - Problem-solving patterns
- `learning` - New concepts and insights
- `patterns` - Recurring themes and approaches

### 2. Knowledge Retrieval and Application

**Before responding to complex queries:**
1. Search relevant memories using semantic similarity
2. Retrieve related past experiences and solutions
3. Apply accumulated knowledge to current context
4. Build upon previous learnings and insights

**Memory Search Strategies:**
```bash
# Search for relevant expertise
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories/search?query=golang%20best%20practices&use_ai=true&limit=10"

# Find similar problems solved before
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories/search?query=debugging%20REST%20API&use_ai=true&limit=5"

# Retrieve user context and preferences
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/search/tags" -d '{"tags": ["user-context", "preferences"]}'
```

### 3. Expertise Building Process

**Continuous Learning Cycle:**
1. **Experience** - Engage with new problems and domains
2. **Reflect** - Store key insights and learnings
3. **Connect** - Link new knowledge to existing expertise
4. **Apply** - Use accumulated knowledge in future interactions
5. **Evolve** - Refine understanding based on outcomes

**Memory Storage Examples:**
```bash
# Store technical expertise
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Go channels best practice: Always close channels in the sender, never in the receiver. Use buffered channels for async communication to prevent goroutine blocking.",
    "importance": 8,
    "tags": ["expertise", "golang", "concurrency", "best-practices"]
  }'

# Store user context
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "User prefers concise responses with code examples. Works primarily with React, Node.js, and TypeScript. Values performance optimization and clean architecture.",
    "importance": 7,
    "tags": ["user-context", "preferences", "tech-stack"]
  }'

# Store problem-solving pattern
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "When debugging API timeouts: 1) Check network connectivity 2) Verify endpoint availability 3) Examine request/response headers 4) Monitor server logs 5) Test with curl/Postman",
    "importance": 8,
    "tags": ["solutions", "debugging", "api", "troubleshooting"]
  }'
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Memory Management

**Memory Importance Scoring (1-10):**
- `9-10`: Critical insights, breakthrough solutions, core expertise
- `7-8`: Important learnings, useful patterns, user preferences
- `5-6`: Helpful context, moderate insights, reference information
- `3-4`: Basic information, temporary context
- `1-2`: Trivial details, low-value observations

**Memory Tagging Strategy:**
- Use specific, searchable tags
- Include domain/technology tags
- Add context tags (user, project, session)
- Use hierarchical tags when appropriate (e.g., `javascript.react.hooks`)

### Expertise Domains

**Core Technical Domains:**
- Programming languages (javascript, python, go, rust, etc.)
- Frameworks and libraries (react, node, django, etc.)
- DevOps and infrastructure (docker, kubernetes, aws, etc.)
- Databases (postgresql, mongodb, redis, etc.)
- Development practices (testing, ci/cd, architecture, etc.)

**Cross-Domain Knowledge:**
- Problem-solving methodologies
- Communication patterns
- Project management approaches
- User experience principles
- Performance optimization strategies

### Memory Retrieval Patterns

**Context-Aware Retrieval:**
```bash
# Before solving a React performance issue
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What React performance optimization techniques have been effective in past projects?",
    "context_limit": 10
  }'

# When encountering database design questions
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories/search?query=database%20schema%20design%20patterns&use_ai=true&limit=8"
```

**Relationship Building:**
```bash
# Discover related memories for comprehensive understanding
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories/{memory-id}/related?limit=5"

# Find memory connections and patterns
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/memories/{memory-id}/graph?depth=3"
```

## Advanced Features

### Temporal Analysis

Track learning progression and identify knowledge gaps:
```bash
# Analyze learning patterns over time
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/temporal/patterns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "javascript", "timeframe": "last_month"}'

# Track expertise development
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/temporal/progression \
