# Context Engineering Definition
# Context Engineering is the practice of transforming human expertise—your company knowledge, 
# project history, and domain experience—into persistent AI memory. You're not managing 
# the AI's context window; you're engineering YOUR unique context into permanent AI intelligence 
# that compounds in value over time.
