**Version**: 2.0  
**Framework**: 8-Section Landing Page Architecture  
**Date**: January 21, 2026

---

## Section 1: HERO

**Job**: Get email or get scroll

### Current (Keep, Minor Additions)

**Eyebrow** (unchanged — this is strong):
> 🟢 100% Local. Your data never leaves.

**Headline** (unchanged):
> AI agents that remember

**Subheadline** (unchanged):
> Stop re-explaining your codebase. Local Memory gives Claude, GPT, and every AI agent persistent memory that survives sessions, switches, and /clear.

## Section 3: PROBLEM-AGITATE 🔧 MAJOR REVISION

**Job**: Make status quo painful. 3 problems with agitation → personal transition.

**Placement**: After SUCCESS section

---

### The Real Cost of Context Amnesia

**Headline**:
> You're bleeding time. Every single session.

**Subheadline**:
> Every time you start a new conversation, you pay the context tax.

---

### Problem 1: The 15-Minute Ritual

> "Let me explain our architecture again..."
>
> Every session starts the same way. You explain your auth patterns. Your API conventions. Why you made that database decision six months ago. Your AI nods along, pretending it doesn't have amnesia.
>
> **15 minutes per session. 5 sessions a day. That's over 6 hours a week re-teaching your tools what they should already know.**

---

### Problem 2: Knowledge That Walks Out the Door

> You spent three hours debugging that WebSocket race condition. You finally fixed it. You explained why the obvious solution made things worse.
>
> Then you typed `/clear`.
>
> Gone. All of it. Tomorrow you'll rediscover the same bug and have the same conversation from scratch.
>
> **Your debugging insights, your architectural decisions, your hard-won patterns — they're training data for corporations, not assets for you.**

---

### Problem 3: The AI You Can't Trust

> "Didn't we already establish this?"
>
> You've told Claude your testing philosophy. You've told GPT your deployment preferences. You've told Cursor your code style.
>
> They remember nothing.
>
> So you stop trusting them with anything important. You keep them at arm's length. And you never get the AI partnership you were promised.

---

### The Math

> **The average developer loses $50-100 per day to context re-explanation.**
>
> 10-15 minutes per session × 5-8 sessions × $50-75/hour = $42-100 daily waste
>
> That's $10,000-25,000 per year. Gone.
>
> Local Memory costs $49. Once.

---

### Transition

> There's a better way. Your context is your competitive advantage. It's time to stop giving it away.

---

## Section 4: VALUE STACK 🔧 MAJOR REVISION

**Job**: 4 tiers descending → Total value → Your price. Make saying no feel stupid.

---

## Section 5: SOCIAL PROOF 🔧 REVISION

**Job**: Let others convince them. 3 testimonials with specific results.

**Placement**: After VALUE STACK

---

### Developers Shipping with Local Memory

**Headline**:
> Don't take our word for it

---

### Testimonial 1: The Workflow Transformer

> "I added a single line to my agentic workflow that forces AI to save every decision and fix to Local Memory. Now during refactors, it searches memories for improvements automatically.
>
> **My code reviews went from 'why did we do this?' to 'here's the context from when we decided.'**"

**— Jamie S.**, Senior Developer

---

### Testimonial 2: The Performance Engineer

> "Latency after warm-up: ~0.5s store, ~0.2s search, ~1.0s relate.
>
> **Local Memory boosted my productivity with Construct Buddy more than any other tool I've added this year.** The response times are production-ready."

**— Devontae W.**, Senior Developer

---

### Testimonial 3: The Skeptic Converted

> "I was skeptical. Another AI memory tool? But this one actually works.
>
> **When the tools are prompted well, the results are amazing — minus the hallucinations.** That's the key difference: it remembers the real context, not made-up nonsense."

**— Neil P.**, Senior Engineer

---

### Optional: Enterprise Proof (if available)

> "A fintech startup cut developer onboarding from 3 weeks to 3 days using Local Memory. The AI walked new engineers through every architectural decision, every gotcha, every 'why we did it this way.'
>
> **That's institutional memory working for you instead of walking out the door.**"

---

## Section 6: TRANSFORMATION ⚠️ NEW SECTION

**Job**: Make outcome tangible. 4 stages: Quick win → Compound → Advantage → 10x

**Placement**: After SOCIAL PROOF

---

### Your Journey with Local Memory

**Headline**:
> From day one to unfair advantage

---

### Day 1: Installation

> Two-minute setup. Your first memory saved.
>
> You tell Claude about your auth patterns. You tell it about your API conventions. This time, it actually remembers.

**Visual**: Terminal showing `local-memory install` → Success

---

### Week 1: Recognition

> Your AI starts finishing your sentences.
>
> "Based on your preference for JWT with 24h expiry..." it begins, without you explaining anything. It remembers the Redis session caching decision. It knows why you chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB.
>
> You stop explaining. You start building.

**Visual**: Search result showing remembered architectural decisions

---

### Month 1: Intelligence

> Patterns emerge across projects.
>
> That debugging insight from Project A? It helps you in Project B. Your AI notices the same error pattern and suggests the fix you discovered last month.
>
> You're not just remembering. You're accumulating advantage.

**Visual**: Relationship graph showing cross-project connections

---

### Quarter 1: Institution

> Your knowledge becomes infrastructure.
>
> New team member joins. Instead of 3 weeks of "let me explain how we do things," your AI walks them through every decision, every convention, every lesson learned.
>
> **You've built institutional memory that doesn't quit, doesn't forget, and doesn't get sick.**

**Visual**: Memory stats dashboard showing growth

---

### The Compound Effect

> Every explanation you save becomes searchable.  
> Every pattern you teach becomes reusable.  
> Every decision you document becomes institutional knowledge.
>
> **This isn't a tool. It's a competitive moat.**

---

## Section 7: SECONDARY CTA 🔧 MINOR REVISION

**Job**: Catch the scrollers

**Placement**: After TRANSFORMATION

---

## Comparison Table (Revised)

**Placement**: Within VALUE STACK section or as standalone

---

### Local Memory vs. The Alternatives

| Capability | Local Memory | Cloud Memory | Markdown Files |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Your data stays local | ✓ Always | ✗ Never | ✓ Always |
| Semantic search | ✓ 10ms | ✓ Variable | ✗ Manual |
| Cross-agent memory | ✓ Universal | ✗ Vendor lock | ✗ Copy/paste |
| Never trains AI models | ✓ Guaranteed | ? Trust required | ✓ Guaranteed |
| Auto-categorization | ✓ AI-powered | ~ Some | ✗ Manual |
| Relationship discovery | ✓ Automatic | ~ Limited | ✗ None |
| Knowledge evolution | ✓ L0→L3 hierarchy | ✗ Flat | ✗ None |
| Contradiction detection | ✓ Built-in | ✗ None | ✗ None |
| **Price** | **$49 once** | **$20-50/mo** | **Free (+ your time)** |

**Note below table**:
> Cloud memory costs $240-600/year and sends your competitive advantage to someone else's servers. Markdown files are free but cost you 6+ hours per week in manual management. Local Memory gives you both: privacy AND intelligence.
